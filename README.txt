Data Structures Assignment 3: Doubly Linked List

To compile the code, type 'make' into the command line.

To run, type './main <input file>' into the command line.

To clean the directory, type 'make clean' into the command line.

Currently this prgram only runs with int-input.txt, int-input2.txt, 
float-input.txt, and string-input.txt. To modify the lists, either change
these files directly or manipulate them within the program. 

The program supports ints, floats, and std::string types only.
